# POSE
Android app POSE

Motion-sensitive alterantive to self-timers. 

With this application, you can set an initial delay, and once it lapses, it automatically tracks any movement within the camera frame using image processing techniques. When the app detects a moment of relative stillness, it snaps a picture for you. 

### Tech stack
Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
